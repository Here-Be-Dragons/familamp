Eagle files with schematic and PCB for familamp

This board uses 4x APA102C LEDs, 1x ESP-12E MCU/Wifi unit, 1x 1117-33 LDO for 3.3V rectification, 6x female PCB risers 
for connecting a 6-pin FTDI interface, 3x2 pcbs pins with jumpers (for programming and capacitive switch), 1x USB-Micro interface 
(for powering the lamp) 1x 1M ohm resistor for the capacitive switch and 1x 0603 1K ohm resistor as a pull-up resistor for programming the ESP

I decided on the ESP-07 for a number of reasons: It has both a chip antenna and a U-FL connector for an external antenna. It has a metal shield for reducing stray RF. It has more available pins.

Enable both jumpers, connect your FTDI USB interface and program the unit.

Disconnect the FTDI, disconnect the jumpers and repower for normal function.


I am very much a novice in PCB design, so please feel free to fork and improve!

Notes:

For the ESP-07 Module, the following ESP pads and pcb pins are used:

GPIO0 - 1K pull-up resistor and 3.3V (opt)
GPIO2 - tied to jumper JP2 with CH_PD
GPIO4 - unused/spare
GPIO5 - unused/spare
GPIO12 - clock signal for APA102
GPIO13 - data signal for APA102
GPIO14 - capacitive switch rcv
GPIO15 - tied to jumper JP1
GPIO16 - capacitive switch send to 1M Ohm resistor (use higher values if you want 'hand wave' activation)
CH_PD - tied to jumper JP2 with GPIO2
TX - FTDI RX
RX - FTDI TX
GND - Ground
VCC - 3.3V regulated current from 1117-33 LDO
JP1 - sets GPO15 low (GND)for programming
JP2 - sets CH_PD and GPIO2 high for programming
send - to copper tape
rcv - to copper tape
